              This sentence is quite dramatic. Instead, I would say that they
              would just multiply and one day expand outward from Earth.
              Machines are already in our daily lives, but human's are still the
              controllers.

            <Typography>
              Every room in my house has at least one object that has been
              programmed to function for a specific purpose, including my
              toothbrush which is in the bathroom. Almost all humans have a
              small device attached to them willingly full of applications that
              have been programmed to entertain, assist, de-stress, etc. So why
              do I want to program? Instead the question would be, how could I
              not.

            Robotics would be my long term goal, but something that I currently
            want to dive deeper into would be mobile applications, ios
            specifically. One reason would be because I myself enjoy leaving my
            house and using applications on the go.

            In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, taking walks in the park
            during a sunny day, and casual games. A new interest is staring at
            the line in stocks as it goes up and down and curved.
